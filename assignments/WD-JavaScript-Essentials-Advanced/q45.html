Form Validtion in JS? 

<!-- JavaScript form validation is the process of verifying that the input values provided by a user in a form are correct, complete, and acceptable before the form data is submitted to the server. This validation is done on the client-side (in the browser) using JavaScript to enhance user experience, reduce server load, and provide immediate feedback. -->
