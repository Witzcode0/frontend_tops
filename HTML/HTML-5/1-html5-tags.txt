HTML5 Tags
HTML5 introduced several new tags to enhance semantic meaning and improve web page structure. Here are some of the most important HTML5 tags:

1. Semantic Elements
These elements provide better meaning to web page content and improve accessibility.

<header>: Defines a header for a document or section.
<footer>: Defines a footer for a document or section.
<nav>: Defines a navigation section (usually for links).
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
<section>: Defines a section in a document, typically with its own heading.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content (like a sidebar).
<main>: Represents the main content of the document.
<figure>: Contains media like images or diagrams, often used with <figcaption> for captions.
<figcaption>: Provides a caption for a <figure>.
<mark>: Highlights or marks text for reference.
<time>: Represents a specific time (e.g., a date, a time of day).

2. Media Elements
HTML5 added native support for multimedia elements:

<audio>: Embeds audio content (supports MP3, Ogg, etc.).
Example :
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<video>: Embeds video content (supports MP4, Ogg, etc.).
Example: 
<video controls width="500">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>

<source>: Specifies multiple media resources for <audio> or <video>.

<track>: Specifies text tracks for <video> or <audio> (e.g., subtitles, captions).

3. Form Elements

HTML5 introduced new form elements to improve user input collection.

<datalist>: Provides an autocomplete feature for <input> elements.
Example: 
<input list="browsers">
<datalist id="browsers">
  <option value="Chrome">
  <option value="Firefox">
  <option value="Safari">
</datalist>

<output>: Displays the result of a calculation.
Example: 
<output name="result" for="a b">0</output>

<progress>: Displays the progress of a task (like a download).
Example: 
<progress value="70" max="100"></progress>

<meter>: Represents a scalar measurement within a known range (such as disk usage or battery level).
Example:
<meter value="2" min="0" max="10">2 out of 10</meter>
