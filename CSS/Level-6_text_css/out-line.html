        The outline property in CSS is used to draw a line (or border) around an element, outside of the element's border. Unlike the border property, the outline does not take up space and can be non-rectangular. Outlines are typically used for accessibility to highlight elements, especially when they receive focus.
        
        syntax:
        element {
            outline: <outline-width> <outline-style> <outline-color>;
        }

        */
        .button {
            outline: 2px dashed #e5902f;
            outline-offset: 5px;
        }
