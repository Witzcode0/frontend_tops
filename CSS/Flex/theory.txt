Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout module that allows you to design complex layouts easily and efficiently. It is used to align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. Flexbox makes it easier to design a responsive layout structure without using floats or positioning.
