    <!-- 
        A transition allows you to change property values smoothly (over a given duration) rather than having them change abruptly. This is commonly used for animations and effects, like when hovering over elements or triggering changes based on user interactions.

        Syntax: 
        transition: property duration timing-function delay;

        Key Properties:
        - property: The CSS property you want to apply the transition to (e.g., width, background-color, etc.).
        - duration: How long the transition takes (e.g., 2s for 2 seconds).
        - timing-function: Specifies the speed curve (e.g., ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, etc.).
        - delay: Defines when the transition should start (optional; e.g., 1s to delay by 1 second).

        Common Use Cases:
        - Changing colors (background, text, borders)
        - Resizing elements (width, height)
        - Changing opacity
        - Moving elements (transform properties like translate, rotate)


        1] Transition Shorthand:
        You can apply transitions to multiple properties by listing them in the shorthand transition property:
            Example: transition: background-color 0.3s ease, width 0.5s ease-in;

        2] Using transition with all:
        Instead of specifying individual properties, you can apply a transition to all animatable properties of an element using all:
            Example: transition: all 0.4s ease;

        3] Timing Functions:

        CSS has built-in timing functions for easing the transition. Some common ones include:
        - ease: Slows down at the beginning and ends quickly at the end, creating a smooth transition.Starts slow, speeds up in the middle, then slows down.
        - linear: The transition is a straight line.[Maintains a constant speed.]
        - ease-in: The transition starts slowly, then speeds up.[Starts slowly and accelerates.]
        - ease-out: The transition starts quickly, then slows down.[Starts quickly and decelerates.]
        - ease-in-out: The transition starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, then slows down again.[Starts slowly, accelerates, and then decelerates.]
        - cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2): Allows you to define custom easing curves.
        - Example: transition: background-color 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1);
        - Note: Be sure to replace the cubic-bezier values with your desired values.
        - Note: The timing function is applied to the entire transition, not just the specified property.
        - Note: The timing function can be used with any property that can be animated (e.g., background-color, width, opacity, transform, etc.).
        - Note: The timing function does not affect the initial state of the element. It only affects the transition effect.
        - Note: The timing function does not affect the final state of the element. It only affects the transition effect.
        - Note: The timing function does not affect the intermediate states during the transition. It only affects the final state of the element.

        4] Transition Delay:
        You can delay the start of a transition with the transition-delay property. This allows for more complex animations:
        Example: transition: background-color 0.3s ease, width 0.5s ease-in 1s; /* Delays start by 1 second */

        5] Transition and :focus
        You can also apply transitions to elements based on focus (e.g., when an input field is selected):
        Example: input {
                    border: 2px solid gray;
                    transition: border-color 0.5s ease-in-out;
                }
                input:focus {
                    border-color: blue;
                }

        6] Using transform with Transition:
        You can create dynamic movement and scaling effects using transform with transitions:
        Example: div {
                    transition: transform 0.5s;
                }
                div:hover {
                    transform: scale(1.5) rotate(45deg);
                }
