▣ CSS Syntax Structure

 ⎔ Selector: Targets the HTML element(s) you want to style.
 ⎔ Declaration Block: Contains one or more declarations enclosed in curly braces {}.
 ⎔ Declaration: Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon :, and each declaration ends with a semicolon ;.
 ⎔ Property: The attribute you want to change (like font, color, etc.)
 ⎔ Value: The specific style you want to apply to the property (like red, bold, etc.)

 Syntax: 

 selector {
    property: value;
    property2: value2;
    /* More declarations */
 }

    color: red;
    font-size: 30px;
 }
