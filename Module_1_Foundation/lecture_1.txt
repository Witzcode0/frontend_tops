*1] How does the Internet Work

The internet is a vast global network that connects millions of devices, allowing them to communicate and share information. It operates by breaking down data into small units called packets, which are transmitted from one device to another using a system of routers and switches. Each device on the internet has a unique IP address, which helps in identifying and routing these packets to the correct destination. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, making it easier for users to navigate the web.

When you access a website, your device acts as a client, sending a request to the web server, which then responds by delivering the requested content. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) supply the necessary infrastructure for this connection. Protocols like TCP/IP ensure that data is reliably transmitted, while HTTPS adds a layer of security to protect sensitive information. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) improve efficiency by storing copies of data closer to users, reducing the time it takes for content to load.

Key Points:

 - Data Transmission: The internet transmits data in small units called packets, which travel from the source to the destination through various routes.

 - IP Addresses: Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address, which helps in identifying and locating devices.

 - DNS (Domain Name System): DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.

 - Routers and Switches: These network devices direct packets of data through the most efficient route to reach their destination.

 - Protocols: The internet uses protocols like TCP/IP to ensure reliable communication between devices.

 - ISP (Internet Service Provider): ISPs provide the necessary infrastructure for users to connect to the internet.

 - Client-Server Model: Most internet services operate on a client-server model, where a client (like a web browser) requests resources from a server (like a website).

 - Web Browsing: When you browse the web, your browser sends a request to a web server, which responds by sending the web page back to your browser.

 - Security: Protocols like HTTPS ensure secure data transmission over the internet, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering.

 - Content Delivery: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) help deliver content more efficiently by storing copies of data closer to the user's location.



*2] DNS and how it works

The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-friendly domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

How DNS Works:
Domain Name Query: When you enter a web address in your browser, it starts by sending a query to a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address.

Recursive DNS Resolver: This query first goes to a recursive DNS resolver, usually provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). The resolver's job is to find the IP address associated with the domain name.

Root Name Server: If the resolver doesn't have the IP address cached, it contacts a root name server. The root server doesn't know the exact IP address but knows where to find it (which Top-Level Domain (TLD) server to ask, e.g., .com, .org).

TLD Name Server: The resolver then queries the TLD server, which points to the authoritative name server for the specific domain (like google.com).

Authoritative Name Server: This server has the final answer and provides the IP address for the domain.

IP Address Returned: The resolver sends the IP address back to your browser, which uses it to access the website's server and load the page.

Caching: To speed up future queries, DNS resolvers and browsers cache the IP addresses they receive for a certain period, reducing the need to go through the full process each time.

Example:
You type www.example.com into your browser.
The browser asks the DNS resolver, "What is the IP address of www.example.com?"
The resolver checks its cache. If it's not there, it asks the root server, "Where can I find the .com domain?"
The root server points to the .com TLD server, which then points to the authoritative server for example.com.
The authoritative server returns the IP address, say 93.184.216.34.
The resolver sends this IP back to your browser, which connects to the web server at that IP and loads the website.


*3] What is HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundational protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web browsers (clients) and servers, enabling the retrieval of web pages and other resources.

Key Aspects of HTTP:
1] Request-Response Model: HTTP operates on a simple request-response model. A client (such as a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server, asking for a specific resource (like a webpage). The server then processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which typically includes the requested resource.

2] Stateless Protocol: HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent of previous requests. The server does not retain information about past interactions, which simplifies communication but can also lead to inefficiencies that are mitigated by using cookies or sessions.

3] Methods: HTTP defines various methods that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource:

GET: Requests data from a server (e.g., loading a webpage).
POST: Sends data to a server, often used in form submissions.
PUT: Updates an existing resource.
DELETE: Deletes a specified resource.
HEAD: Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers, not the body of the resource.

4] Headers: HTTP requests and responses include headers, which provide metadata about the request or response, such as content type, encoding, caching instructions, and more.

5] Status Codes: HTTP responses come with status codes that indicate the outcome of the request:

200 OK: The request was successful, and the resource is returned.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error processing the request.

6] HTTPS: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP that adds a layer of encryption using SSL/TLS to secure data transmitted between the client and server. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information like passwords and payment details.

How HTTP Works:
 - You enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in your web browser, which translates into an HTTP request.
 - The browser sends this request to the server hosting the website.
 - The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, typically containing the HTML of the webpage.
 - Your browser renders this HTML, displaying the webpage on your screen.


*4] Browsers and how they work?

A web browser is a software application that allows you to access and interact with websites on the internet. It serves as the interface between you and the web, enabling you to view, navigate, and interact with content like text, images, videos, and more.

How Browsers Work:
-----------------
1] User Input: You start by entering a URL (like www.example.com) or a search query in the browser's address bar.

2] DNS Lookup: The browser needs to know the IP address of the server hosting the website. It sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address.

3] HTTP/HTTPS Request: Once the IP address is obtained, the browser sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to the web server at that IP address, asking for the specific webpage or resource.

4] Server Response: The web server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes the requested resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) and status code.

5] Rendering Engine: The browser's rendering engine (like Blink in Chrome, WebKit in Safari, or Gecko in Firefox) interprets the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and converts it into a visual representation on your screen. This process involves:

 - Parsing HTML: The browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) tree from the HTML.
 - Parsing CSS: The browser applies styles to the DOM elements according to the CSS rules.
 - Rendering Layout: The browser calculates the layout of elements on the page.
 - Painting: The browser paints the visual elements (text, colors, images) on the screen.
 - JavaScript Execution: The browser's JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome) executes any JavaScript code, enabling interactive features.
 - Displaying the Webpage: The fully rendered webpage is displayed to you. The browser continues to listen for user interactions (like clicks, scrolls, or form submissions) and may send additional requests to the server as needed (e.g., to load more data or submit a form).

6] Caching: To speed up future visits, the browser may cache certain resources (like images, scripts, or stylesheets). This allows the browser to load the page faster by retrieving these resources from local storage instead of downloading them again.

7] Security: Browsers enforce security measures to protect users, such as blocking malicious websites, enforcing HTTPS, and isolating website data (sandboxing) to prevent harmful scripts from affecting other parts of your system.

Key Features of Browsers:
 - Tabs: Allow you to open multiple websites in a single window.
 - Bookmarks: Save and organize frequently visited websites for quick access.
 - Extensions/Add-ons: Customize and enhance browser functionality with additional tools like ad blockers, password managers, and more.
 - Private Browsing: Browse without saving history, cookies, or other data.
 - Developer Tools: Provide tools for developers to inspect and debug web pages, analyze performance, and test responsive design.

Popular Web Browsers:
 - Google Chrome: Known for speed, extensive extension support, and integration with Google services.
 - Mozilla Firefox: Focuses on privacy, customization, and open-source development.
 - Safari: Optimized for Apple devices, emphasizing performance and energy efficiency.
 - Microsoft Edge: Built on Chromium (like Chrome), with features tailored for Windows users.
 - Opera: Known for its innovative features like a built-in VPN and ad blocker.

 *5] What is Domain Name?

A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites on the internet. It serves as a convenient way for people to find and visit websites without needing to remember complex numerical IP addresses, which are the actual addresses of servers on the internet.

Key Components of a Domain Name:
1] Top-Level Domain (TLD): The TLD is the suffix at the end of the domain name, such as .com, .org, .net, .edu, or country-specific codes like .uk (United Kingdom) or .in (India). TLDs are broadly categorized into:

2] Generic TLDs (gTLDs): Commonly used for general purposes (e.g., .com, .org).
Country Code TLDs (ccTLDs): Associated with specific countries or regions (e.g., .us, .fr).
Second-Level Domain (SLD): This is the part of the domain name that comes before the TLD. It is usually the name of the organization, brand, or website. For example, in example.com, "example" is the SLD.

3] Subdomain: A subdomain is an optional part that precedes the second-level domain. It helps organize different sections of a website. For instance, in blog.example.com, "blog" is the subdomain. The www commonly seen in www.example.com is also a subdomain.

How Domain Names Work:
1] Registration: Domain names are registered through domain registrars, companies that manage the reservation of domain names. Once a domain name is registered, it becomes unique to the registrant.

2] DNS Resolution: When you enter a domain name in a web browser, the Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain name into the corresponding IP address of the server where the website is hosted. This allows your browser to connect to the server and load the website.

3] Hierarchy: The DNS system is hierarchical, with root name servers at the top level. These servers help direct the query to the appropriate TLD servers, which then direct it to the authoritative name servers responsible for the specific domain.

Example:
 -- Domain Name: www.example.com
     - Subdomain: www
     - Second-Level Domain (SLD): example
     - Top-Level Domain (TLD): .com

Importance of Domain Names:
 - Brand Identity: A domain name often reflects the brand, company name, or the nature of the website, making it easy for users to remember and find.
 - Accessibility: Domain names simplify access to websites by providing a human-friendly address instead of a numeric IP address.
 - SEO: A relevant and keyword-rich domain name can improve search engine rankings and visibility.

*5] What is hosting?

Hosting refers to the service of providing the necessary infrastructure and resources to store and deliver websites or web applications on the internet. When you create a website, the files (such as HTML, CSS, images, and scripts) need to be stored on a server that is connected to the internet so that people can access your site from anywhere in the world. Hosting services provide the space on these servers, along with the necessary tools and technologies, to make your website accessible online.

Types of Hosting:

1] Shared Hosting:
