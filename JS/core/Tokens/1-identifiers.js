/* 
Identifiers are names given to elements in a programming language, such as variables, functions, classes, and modules. They are used to uniquely identify and reference these elements within the code.


Rules for Identifiers

The specific rules for identifiers can vary slightly between different programming languages, but here are some common guidelines:

Character Set:
- Letters: Both uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters are typically allowed.
- Digits: Numbers (0-9) can be used, but usually not as the first character.
- Special Characters: Some languages allow special characters like underscores (_) or dollar signs ($) in identifiers, but their usage can vary.

Keywords:
- Avoid using reserved words (keywords) as identifiers, as they have predefined meanings in the language.

Case Sensitivity:
- Some languages are case-sensitive, meaning variable and Variable are considered different identifiers. Others are case-insensitive.

Starting Characters:
- Most languages require the first character of an identifier to be a letter or underscore.

Length:
- There may be limitations on the maximum length of identifiers.

Naming Conventions:
While not strictly enforced by the language, it's good practice to follow naming conventions to improve code readability. Common conventions include:

- CamelCase: Starting with a lowercase letter and capitalizing each subsequent word (e.g., myVariable).
- PascalCase: Capitalizing the first letter of each word (e.g., MyVariable).
- Snake Case: Separating words with underscores (e.g., my_variable).
