/* Arrays can store other arrays as elements, creating a multi-dimensional structure like 2D arrays (matrices), 3D arrays, etc.

2d matrix:

let matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];

3d matrix:

let threeD = [
    [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    [[5, 6], [7, 8]],
    [[9, 10], [11, 12]]
];
