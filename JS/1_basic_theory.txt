jQuery Basics

a) jQuery Introduction

What is jQuery?
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Why Use jQuery?

Simplifies JavaScript: Makes JavaScript coding easier by offering pre-built methods.
Cross-browser compatibility: jQuery ensures that code works across different browsers.
Rich library: It provides a wide range of functions for DOM manipulation, event handling, animation, etc.


b) jQuery Getting Started
Include jQuery in Your Project
There are two ways to include jQuery:

Via CDN:

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
Download and Host Locally:
Download the jQuery library from the official site: jQuery.com.
Add it in your project folder and reference it:

<script src="js/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
Basic jQuery Setup:

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    // Your jQuery code here
  });
</script>


c) jQuery Syntax
jQuery syntax is based on the combination of CSS selectors and actions.

Basic jQuery Syntax:

$(selector).action();
$(): The dollar sign is used to access jQuery.
selector: Selects HTML elements.
action(): Perform an action on the selected elements (e.g., .hide(), .show()).

Example:
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("p").hide(); // Hides all <p> elements
});



d) jQuery Selectors
jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML elements.

Common Selectors:

Element Selector: Selects all elements with a given tag.

$("p"); // Selects all <p> elements
ID Selector: Selects a specific element by ID.
$("#myID"); // Selects the element with ID="myID"
Class Selector: Selects all elements with a given class.
$(".myClass"); // Selects all elements with class="myClass"


e) jQuery Events
jQuery makes it easy to handle events like clicks, keypresses, mouse actions, etc.

Common jQuery Events:

click(): Runs a function when an element is clicked.
$("#myButton").click(function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

mouseenter(): Triggers when the mouse pointer enters an element.
$("#myDiv").mouseenter(function() {
  $(this).css("background-color", "yellow");
});

keyup(): Fires when a key is released on the keyboard.
$("#myInput").keyup(function() {
  alert("Key released!");
});
